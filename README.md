# happenings

Happenings is a simple android application created for the requirements of the course Mobile Application Development, that I have attended during my Masterâ€™s degree in Communication and Information Systems at the Technological Educational Institute of Central Macedonia www.teicm.gr.

The android application presents to the end user a list of various events around the world and detailed information about them. All the information is accessed from a web server PHP application. The server side PHP application connects to a mysql database which holds all the data, sends queries to it and then returns the resulted data to the client app in JSON format.
